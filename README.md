# Bookapo UI Re-Engineering Project

**Project Type:** Frontend UI/UX Re-Engineering  
**Platform:** Desktop-first Web (1440px)  
**Author:** Ahmad Reza Kordi 

## Overview
This project is a desktop-first UI clone of the Bookapo website.

The main goal of this project is to replicate the **layout, visual hierarchy, and interaction patterns** of a real production website using clean and structured frontend code.

The focus is on **CSS architecture, layout composition, and UI accuracy**, not backend logic.

## Why this project matters
Cloning a real-world website demonstrates:
- Practical CSS skills
- Understanding of spacing, typography, and hierarchy
- Ability to work with large UI structures
- Attention to visual detail

This project shows the ability to translate real designs into functional, maintainable code.

## Features
- Desktop-first layout (1440px baseline)
- Multi-section landing page
- Navigation menus and submenus
- Sliders and carousels
- Search UI with overlay
- Audio preview player
- Structured footer with multiple columns

---

## Technical Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox-based layout)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- No frameworks or UI libraries

## Responsiveness (Honest Note)
This project is **not fully responsive**.

- Optimized for desktop (primary target)
- Partial tablet behavior
- Mobile version intentionally not completed

Reason:
This is a **layout & UI clone project**, not a production application.
Time was intentionally invested in:
- Visual accuracy
- Clean CSS structure
- Real-world scale UI

Rather than shallow responsiveness with reduced quality.
